RubyDung 2009 API
-----------------
This is a crazy API from crazy people providing a ***modding API*** for one of the ***first versions of Minecraft*** from the year 2009 (back then still named *RubyDung*).

This repository contains only bare API abstract classes and interfaces, similarly to Bukkit - without any implementations into the actual game. It should only serve as a starting point to allow people the creation of a modded RubyDung experience.

You may want to check the [RDModded repository]() for the actual modded game experience.

You may also want to check the [Minecraft Veteran Servers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiKrpX4ViX4PGBOq1UXlvQ) for videos on creation of all this nonsense and perhaps some inspiration for creation of your own game / Minecraft clone :-D 

No source code from Notch, Mojang or Microsoft is used in this or any other repositories related to this project.
